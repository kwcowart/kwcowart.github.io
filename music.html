                Twin Fantasy by Car Seat Headrest is a 2011 indie rock album, later re-released in 2018. The emotion in
                each song on this album really resonated with me as a kid, and it was one the things that made me
                interested in music. To this day it remains my favorite album.

                Wildflower is a 2016 plunderphoncis/hip hop album by The Avalanches. The songs on this album are hevily
                focused around samples and feature a mix between hip hop and psychadelic sound. I think it's really cool
                how an album made from a bunch of samples could sound so unique and incredible.

                I'll Try Living Like This is a 2015 vaporwave album by death's dynamic shroud. I started getting into
                this album recently, but I've always been a fan of the vaporwave genre. That being said, I think this
                album stands out because many vaporwave songs don't really add too much beyond the base samples, but
                this album is great at that.
