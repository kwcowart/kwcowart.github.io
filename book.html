                The Left Hand of Darkness by Urusula K. Le Guin is a science fiction book from 1969 where the main
                character visits a planet where the climate, culture, and even biology of its inhabitants are foreign.
                The world building in this book is some of the best I've ever seen, and the writing and storytelling are
                equally incredible.

                The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson is a fantasy novel set in a world where magic storms periodically
                ravage the land. This book is the first in a series of many books, and the magic system that it features
                is more developed than any I've ever seen. The characters are written wonderfully, and the way Sanderson
                sets up the plot here shows an incredible level of thought into the world.

                Dune by Frank Herbert is a science fiction book about politics, religion, and survival on the desert
                planet Arrakis. While the other books on this list are similar, Dune's politics are like no other. On
                the other hand, however, I found the book to be a little dry in some places (pun intended).
                Nevertheless, there's a reason it's considered a classic.
