                Alien is a 1979 science fiction horror movie directed by Ridley Scott. The movie follows the crew of a
                starship who accidentally encounter a very dangerous alien creature that they are forced to survive
                against. In my opinion, this movie is one of the greatest horror movies of all time. First of all, I'm a
                sucker for science fiction, and the atmosphere and retro-futuristic aesthetics of the movie give it an
                otherworldly feeling that few movies have successfully instilled.

                Inglourious Basterds is a 2009 movie directed by Quentin Tarantino about two simultaneous (fictional)
                plots to assasinate Hitler during World War 2. I'm not a fan of most Tarantino movies, but for some
                reason I quite enjoy Inglourious Basterds. The movie does a great job with the comedic
                aspects while also taking the concept seriously.

                District 9 is a 2009 science fiction movie directed by Neill Blomkamp about an alien race that is
                confined to an internment camp in South Africa. The whole movie is a metaphor for apartheid and is
                inspired by the real life District 6. I think the movie does an excellent job of making its point while
                still being entertaining and engaging, although the film does have a number of shortcomings.
